# Nim bindings to the FFTW3 library.

Set of Nim bindings to the excellent
[FFTW library](http://www.fftw.org/), to compute Fourier transforms of
various kinds.

I generated these bindings in a hurry because I needed them for a
project of mine. Therefore, only the functions that use `double`
values have been implemented (no `float` or `long double` functions,
sorry -- by the way, at the time of writing, the `long double` type is
not yet supported by Nim).

**Warning**: This repository is currently archived, as I am no longer interested in Nim.

# Documentation

No documentation, sorry. The bindings are very tiny, so if you're
accustomed with the C interface of FFTW, you're going to have no
problems.

# Examples

A very short example about how to use these bindings is provided at
the end of
[fftw3.nim](https://github.com/ziotom78/nimfftw3/blob/master/fftw3.nim).

# License

These bindings are released under a MIT license, but since the FFTW
library is covered by a GPL license, any program you'll write which
use these bindings will need to be released under GPL, as this link
explains: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLWrapper.
